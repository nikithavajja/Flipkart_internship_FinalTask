Title: Maritime Performance Analytics & Sea-Route Risk Assessment System for Ships/Submarines
1. Project Overview
The Maritime Performance Analytics & Sea-Route Risk Assessment System is a comprehensive data analytics project designed to analyze ship and submarine operational performance using multi-source maritime datasets.
The project integrates navigation logs, environmental conditions, fuel consumption data, and maintenance records to evaluate vessel efficiency, fuel usage, weather impact, sea-route risks, and operational delays.
This project focuses purely on Data Analytics and Statistical Modeling, without mandatory machine learning, and provides actionable insights through visual dashboards.
2. Objectives
•	Clean and preprocess multi-source maritime datasets
•	Integrate navigation, fuel, environmental, and maintenance data
•	Analyze ship and submarine performance metrics
•	Evaluate fuel consumption and engine efficiency
•	Assess weather impact on navigation and delays
•	Identify high-risk sea routes
•	Analyze submarine depth vs speed efficiency
•	Build an interactive dashboard for maritime insights
3. Dataset Details
The project uses multiple cleaned datasets merged into a unified master table.
Key Datasets:
•	Ship Specifications Dataset
•	Navigation Logs Dataset
•	Environmental Conditions Dataset
•	Fuel Consumption Logs
•	Maintenance & Incident Logs
Master Dataset:
maritime_master_dataset.csv
Important Columns:
•	vessel_id
•	vessel_type
•	speed_knots
•	fuel_used_lph
•	distance_nm
•	depth_m
•	wave_height_m
•	wind_speed_knots
•	storm_probability
•	course_deviation_deg
•	maintenance_type
•	incident_type
4. Data Cleaning Steps
•	Removal of duplicate records
•	Handling missing values using forward-fill methods
•	Standardizing timestamp and coordinate formats
•	Validating numerical ranges (speed, depth, fuel)
•	Separating submarine-specific depth data
•	Saving cleaned datasets into processed folder
5. Feature Engineering
The following analytical features were created:
•	Nautical Miles per Liter
•	Fuel Efficiency Score
•	Engine Health Score
•	Vessel Utilization Rate
•	Depth-Speed Efficiency Index (Submarines)
•	Environmental Delay Hours
•	Sea-Route Risk Score
•	Risk Category (Low / Medium / High)
6. Analytical Models (Non-ML)
Fuel Efficiency Model
•	Measures distance traveled per unit fuel
•	Normalized efficiency score (0–100)
Engine Health Model
•	Based on RPM variance and maintenance frequency
Delay Impact Model
•	Weather-based delay estimation using wave height, wind speed, storm probability
Sea-Route Risk Model
•	Composite risk score using environmental and navigation indicators
Depth-Speed Efficiency Model (Submarines)
•	Evaluates optimal underwater operational depths
7. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key analyses performed:
•	Vessel speed vs wave height
•	Fuel consumption vs load weight
•	Submarine depth vs speed trends
•	Weather impact on route deviation
•	Maintenance frequency by vessel type
•	Risk-prone sea corridor identification
•	Correlation heatmaps of numerical variables
Generated visualizations include:
•	Bar charts
•	Histograms
•	Heatmaps
•	Bubble charts
•	Line graphs
8. Dashboard
A Streamlit-based interactive dashboard was developed to:
•	Display vessel KPIs
•	Visualize fuel consumption trends
•	Analyze depth vs speed for submarines
•	Monitor sea-route risk levels
•	Compare performance across vessel types
