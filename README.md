🚢 Maritime Performance Analytics & Sea-Route Risk Assessment System

📌 Project Overview
This project builds an end-to-end **Maritime Data Analytics System** to analyze ship and submarine performance, fuel efficiency, environmental impact, navigation risks, and maintenance patterns using multi-source marine datasets.

The system integrates navigation logs, environmental data, fuel consumption records, and maintenance incidents to generate actionable maritime intelligence.
